*Full stack project • 4 member team • 5 day remote sprint*

What'll Ya Have is designed to help people make cocktails. Users can search the cocktails database by name or ingredient and are returned a list of cocktails that match their search criteria. As an added bonus there is also a 'Random Cocktail' button.  Saved recipes can be stored in the Menu feature.  I wrote the code to fetch the data from The Cocktail API, which was utilized for our recipe data.  Along with a teammate, I helped create the cocktail detail page on the front end which munged and dynamically rendered the recipe details. The dynamic header component, which renders different navigation based on the authorization status of the user was also one of my contributions to this project.
