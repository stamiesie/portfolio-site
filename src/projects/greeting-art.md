Greeting Art combines a fun random art generator and gallery with an e-greeting card service in one easy-to-use app.  Using the P5.js library, I helped implement the creation of algorithmic artwork by building randomizing functions that altered the sizes, shapes and colors on the canvas element.  To display art in the app's gallery feature, I pair-programmed the connection of an AWS S3 bucket with the front-end using POST and GET routes.
