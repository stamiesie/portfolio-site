Ambience Bot is a discord bot that allows users to stream ambient sounds directly to a discord voice channel.  The bot is controlled with command functions that fetch audio from YouTube and stream to Discord using the YTDL module.  I contributed to this project by helping code the implementation of the YouTube API call with the user's search query to return an audio stream to Discord.  Additionally, I build a stop function command allowing the bot to cease playing audio.
